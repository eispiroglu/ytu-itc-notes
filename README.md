# ytu-itc-notes

This is a repository that I have prepared for publishing my answers (flowcharts, codes etc.) and notes about CS lesson. Also you can publish your notes too (just fork and open PR)

**Note: These files are NOT prepared by any teacher, instead, prepared by me. So there might be wrong answers or notes. Reminder this while using them. And if you find some errors, you can open issues. If you have alternative options to solve algorithms, feel free to create Pull Request :)**

Another Note: There might be missing algorithms, I will try to add missing ones as soon as possible.
