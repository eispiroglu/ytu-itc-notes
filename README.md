# ytu-itc-notes

This is a repository that I have prepared for publishing my answers (flowcharts, codes etc.) and notes.
**Note: These files are NOT prepared by any teacher. So there might be wrong answers or notes. Reminder that while using them. And if you find some error, feel free to create Pull Request :)**
